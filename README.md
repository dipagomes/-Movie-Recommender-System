# -Movie-Recommender-System
The purpose of a recommendation system basically is to search for content
that would be interesting to an individual. Moreover, it involves a number of
factors to create personalized lists of useful and interesting content specific to
each user/individual. Recommendation systems are Machine Learning-based
algorithms that skim through all possible options and create a customized
list of items that are interesting and relevant to an individual. These results
are based on their profile, search/browsing history, what other people with
similar traits/demographics are watching, and how likely are to watch those
movies. This is achieved through predictive modeling and heuristics with the
data available. <br>
Nowadays OTT platforms are more popular mediums to enjoy movies. This
platform is not only popular for its content only. They are popular for their
accurate recommendation system. Their system can detect what type of
people and what kind of content is like. So our purpose of this project is to
make a recommendation system for the user.
